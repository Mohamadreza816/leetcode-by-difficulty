# LeetCode Solutions ðŸš€

This repository contains my solutions to various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems.  
I started solving problems to improve my understanding of **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **problem-solving skills**.  
The problems are categorized by difficulty and will be updated regularly as I solve more.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

The solutions are organized by difficulty level:

 easy/ <br>
 medium/ <br>
 hard/ 


Each file contains a Python solution to a single LeetCode problem.  
Some solutions include comments to explain the logic. Over time, I may also add multiple approaches or optimizations for some problems.

## ðŸ›  Languages

Currently, I'm solving problems in **Python**.  
In the future, I might add solutions in other languages like C++ or JavaScript.

## ðŸ”„ Updates

This repository is a **work in progress**.  
I'll keep adding new solutions as I continue solving more problems.

Feel free to explore the solutions or suggest better approaches!
